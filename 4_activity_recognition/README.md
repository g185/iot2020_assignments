
## Assignment 3: Crowdsensing activity recognition using Generic Sensor API and AWS
## The Assignment
This project is the solution for the Fourth Assignment of IoT 2020 course in Sapienza University. 
It consisted in the implementation of an activity recognitions system based on the application onf Crowdsensing.
I Built two different implementations: Cloud and Edge based.
The Cloud based solution consist in a solution where the sensor applications sends raw data to the backend that than 
process them using lambda functions.
The Edge based one is doing all the process on the sensor application instead.
This repository contains the code for the two different implementations.
Each implementations folder contains the script for the different tasks.
In particular, there are the lambda functions that are used in order to process or display the data contained in the 
database and the code for both the sensor application and the dashboard.
The functionalities are explained in the video below. An Hands-on Tutorial can be found below, where I presented a step-to-step guide 
that expains in depth the concept and implementation of the code above.
