## Assignment 2: Environmental Stations Dashboard using AWS framework
## The Assignment
This project is the solution for the First Assignment of IoT 2020 course in Sapienza University. It consisted in creating a cloud-based IoT system that collects information from two of virtual environmental sensors using the MQTT protocol displaying the data collected from the sensors on a public web site.
In this project i was assigned to use AWS framework in order to structurate the backend of my solution.
The solution that i was able to find consist in the use of different AWS components in order to build a serverless webapp that was able to fetch real time data in a database, continuously filled with the published information of the enviromental stations.
