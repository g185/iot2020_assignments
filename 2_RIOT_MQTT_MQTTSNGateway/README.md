## Assignment 2: RIOT MQTT MQTTSN gateway
## The Assignment
This project is the solution for the Second Assignment of IoT 2020 course in Sapienza University. It consisted in creating a RIOT-OS native emulator that was able to publish sensors into AWS cloud environment.
For this purpose i decided to implement a local MQTTSN-Gateway to MQTT Broker structure in order to publish the data from the RIOT-OS emulator.
I also included the code from iot-lab sperimetation in which I was not able to enstablish connection between mqttsn and emcute device for network problems. Nonetheless i developed code in order to retrieve real temperature data and output in a format like the real payload and an emcute-like main in order to publish the real values into the mqttsn.
